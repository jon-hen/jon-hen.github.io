After changing your password of your Office 365 account, your credentials used in Microsoft Project also need to be changed.

To fix this:

  1. Open MS Project
  2. Open a blank project
  3. Click the ‘**File**’ button at the top right (as if you were to save a document).
  4. Then click ‘**Account**’, which is almost at the bottom of the menu.
  5. If the incorrect account is shown, click ‘**Switch Account first**’.
  6. Then click the ‘**Sign Out**’ button for the account you use with Project Server as shown in the picture below.
  7. Then enter your credentials again when trying to open a project from Microsoft Project Server.

**Note:** This will not work if you are using the same account to log in to Windows.
