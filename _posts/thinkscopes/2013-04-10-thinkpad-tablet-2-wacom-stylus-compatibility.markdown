If you do not like the Wacom pen that comes with your ThinkPad Tablet 2, you can use the Wacom pen that came with the ThinkPad X series tablet (X60, X61t, X200t, X201t, X220t, and X230t). The larger Wacom pen from the ThinkPad X series Tablet is not only easier to grip, it is also more precise then the small Wacom pen that comes with the TPT2.

Furthermore the ThinkPad X series Wacom pen's red button (or grey button if you have an old ThinkPad X series Tablet Pen) at the end, can function as an 'eraser' in Microsoft OneNote, which is sadly missing on the smaller TPT2 Wacom pen. So if you do lot of inking or drawing, then it is probably a good idea to get the ThinkPad X series Wacom pen and use that with your ThinkPad Tablet 2.
