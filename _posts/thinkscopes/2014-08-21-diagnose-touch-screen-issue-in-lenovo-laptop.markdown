There are several ways to diagnose whether this is a hardware or software issue. The most easiest method to diagnose the hardware issue, is to actually boot into the BIOS menu and test the touchscreen feature in that environment.

If your touchscreen doesn't work in the BIOS environment, then most likely you have a hardware issue.
