The X1 Tablet Gen 3 is exciting. The X1 Tablet Gen 2 didn't have any new features. But this year, it's completely different. The modular design is gone, so you don't have to buy any separate modules.

The size of the X1 Tablet has been increased from 12" to 13", increasing productivity. This means the keyboard is now bigger. The display in the X1 Tablet Gen 3 uses a display resolution of 3000x2000. There is also an optional either both or just rear IR camera. The frontÂ  camera has a 2.0 megapixel resolution with fixed focus, whereas the rear camera uses auto focus.

The weight of the X1 Tablet Gen 3 with keyboard comes at 1.27 kg.

Inside, we now find the long awaited 15W TDP Kaby Lake Refresh quad core processors. This makes the X1 Tablet Gen 3 roughly 3 times faster than its predecessors. The graphics card is a Intel HD 620.

You can store the digitizer pen inside the X1 Tablet, that is if we're looking at the picture below correctly. This is a huge improvement over its predecessors where it was clipped on the side. No more losing pens if this is true.

The digitizer pen has two buttons. This is all the information I currently have on this.

Memory is soldered up to dual channel 16GB LPDDR3. Downside is lack of upgradeability, upside is improved performance over a single SODIMM slot.

Battery life is up to 9.5 hours on a integrated 42Wh internal battery. The X1 Tablet Gen 2 used a 2-cell 37Wh battery which lasted up to 10 hours.

The charging port is now a USB-C port. The AC adapter is a 65W adapter.
