The Lenovo Dual-Mode Wireless Touch Mouse N700 was probably designed after the popular Yoga ultrabook convertibles of Lenovo. The idea behind this 'dual-mode' mouse was to have a mouse and a laser presenter in one device. I think the N700 succeeds here.

### Connectivity


There are two ways of using the N700 as a mouse. You can either use the wireless dongle included, or you pair it with the bluetooth adapter of your notebook, ultrabook or desktop. Using the dongle is quite obvious, you plug in the USB dongle and it works. I have read many bad reviews about pairing with Bluetooth, some of these examples are that the N700 doesn't work with BlueTooth on Windows 8.1. Which is not true. It took me 5 seconds to pair my mouse using BlueTooth on my ThinkPad W530 running Windows 8.1. [The manual](http://download.lenovo.com/consumer/options/lenovo_dual_mode_wireless_touch_mouse_n700.pdf) explains very well how to pair it using BlueTooth. Technically you have to put the slider below to the left to pair it with your computer, and the N700 will show up in the detected devices' list. You only need to go once through the pairing process. After that, it just works.

### Using the N700


The shape of the N700 may feel awkward at first, because it's because it doesn't have a rounded shape, but rather angular and it feels slightly flatter and smaller. It's about 1,5cm less tall than my [Lenovo USB Black Optical Mouse](http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/product-and-parts/detail.page?&LegacyDocID=MIGR-50989). Scrolling is quite fun, because you have to swipe the middle mouse button's surface. You don't get as much tactile feedback as a regular scrolling wheel. But it's also not too sensitive. The gestures are also quite fun to use. Having to move your mouse pointer to the sides feels like travelling a lot with your mouse pointer, if you don't know the actual keyboard shortcuts. Managing tasks is also much easier than Alt+tabbing, which the average computer user has never heared of. If you press Alt+Tab in Windows, you can switch tasks or open programs easily. On the N700 all you have to do is swipe from the left to the right. Swiping from the right to the left will open the charms bar. Well let's test what the N700 is worth as a mouse for gaming. I fired up America's Army: Proving Grounds to do the test.Â The mouse feels a bit awkward to make responsive reactions in-game at first, but it's something you get used too. Surprisingly the mouse gestures also work in-game. So if you swipe to the left or to the right, you can also bind these gestures to do something useful in your favorite game. Scrolling wasn't also too sensitive, I was really scared about this. But the sensitivity of the mouse wheel was just in the sweet spot. The mouse's two gestures can also be mapped in your favorite game.

### Presenter mode


The laser only works if the mouse is completely flat as shown in the picture below. The laser can be activated by holding the middle mouse button. I have tested the laser pointer at up to 40 meters distance. I am sure it may go even further.

The N700 works as advertised. Everything works as expected, and everything is well-documented in [the manual](http://download.lenovo.com/consumer/options/lenovo_dual_mode_wireless_touch_mouse_n700.pdf). It feels like you are having a quality product in your hands. The only thing you may need to get used to is the shape of the mouse. If you don't have one and you do presentations on a regular basis, don't hesitate to buy one it's the perfect companion for your Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 experience. You also get two options to connect it to your computer. The price is really justified with the added functionality.
