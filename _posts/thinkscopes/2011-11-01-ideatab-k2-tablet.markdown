Hi readers, my name is Peter 'Pete' Barnette, i am the co-editor of this site and a self proclaimed [Lenovo Tablet Evangelist](http://forum.lenovo.com/t5/Community-Spotlight/In-the-Spotlight-MrPeter1985/ba-p/565767). This is my first post on the Think.Scopes website and hopefully readers will be interested in my opinions and insights into the various Lenovo Tablets and idea branded systems (Editor: Remember to share 50% of all the Lenovo goodies you get!!!).

It has been nearly 6 months since the release of the IdeaPad K1 Android Tablet which runs on the Tegra 250 T20 Dual Core CPU, and with the release of the Tegra 3 (Kal-EI) series of quad core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore by Nvidia, most of the computer brand companies are rushing to market with tablets having this processors inside them. This is the first time since the start of the tablet war that the Android powered tablet have a SoC processing power that can nearly match what is offered by the iPad series. However, since most people won't run benchmark on their tablets like they would on desktops/laptops, these people would usually gauge the relative performance of their tablets from outright SoC specifications. So having 4 cores in the new tablets would surely entice a lot of people to buy the Tegra 3 equipped tablets for their Christmas present.

ASUS i think was the first manufacturer to announce the new tablets with Tegra 3, and now Lenovo not to be outdone have also released information about the immiment release of their new IdeaPad K2 Tablet. So lets have a little sneak preview of this yummy new ideapad tablet from Lenovo (my most favourite computer company.. wink.. wink).

So with the new Tegra 3 T33 quad core SoC running on the new IdeaPad K2, the performance of the K2 is about 2.5 times faster than that of the K1 running on the older Tegra 2 SoC. (Benchmark comparision of the tablets can be found [here](http://www.glbenchmark.com/phonedetails.jsp?benchmark=glpro21&D=Lenovo+LePad+K2&testgroup=system))

The K2 will also feature:



  * 2 GB of 1600 Mhz DDR3 RAM

  * A full size USB socket (like on the Lenovo ThinkPad Android Tablet)

  * Back and Front facing camera

  * Back facing camera should have LED flashlight

  * A fingerprint scanner on the back of the laptop that can act as a optical trackpad.

  * Anodised aluminium backcasing? (need to confirm)

  * MicroSD slots? (need to confirm)

  * Ice Cream Sandwich version of Android


From the various pictures i have seen from the IdeaPad K2, the quality of construction and tolerance of fit are much improved. Hopefully, the K2 has the 3G option, which is sadly absent on the K1. The release of the K2 should mean that the K1 will soon be sold on a discount, which is the case with many other tablet manufacturers. Okay, i will post more as get more information on the ideapad K2.
