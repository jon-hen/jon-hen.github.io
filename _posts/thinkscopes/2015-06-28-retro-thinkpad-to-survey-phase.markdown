David Hill has replied to [his blog article](http://blog.lenovo.com/en/blog/retro-thinkpad-time-machine/). It appears to be that the article was a huge success and exceeded all expectations.

When I was the first to publish my review of the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 3 at January 5 2015, I did not generate as much traffic as the retro ThinkPad announcement did of David Hill. As a comparison, the review of the X1 Carbon Gen 3 has generated about 150k-200k views in half a year compared to the ThinkPad Retro Project in 2-3 days.

Insane, right?

David Hill claims that they are debating all the ThinkPad features seen in the comments, and that he is happy to see these same features are debated as well in the comments. Which means the idea of the retro ThinkPad is on the right track.

However instead of analyzing over 2000 comments, David Hill will be writing a detailed survey where you can give all your input, so he can design the perfect retro ThinkPad for everyone.

While some people do not really care about the multi-color logo it is uncertain if we will see it in the final product. What would you prefer? The current silver ThinkPad logo or the new multi-color logo from the blog article?

Another feature not mentioned in the blog article was internet backward and forward keys, this is a much requested feature by the community. But the truth is that you can also use your backspace key to go back a page.

If you are a true ThinkPad fan make sure to follow ThinkScopes or Bill Morrow's ThinkPad forums in [the Announcements section](http://forum.thinkpads.com/viewforum.php?f=76). We will cover all the news regarding the ThinkPad Retro Project and keep you up to date.

And the question remains whether the success of the retro ThinkPad will affect the mainstream models as well in time. If the retro ThinkPad becomes a true success, why not go back in time and change the design for all the models.

While we are waiting on David Hill's next move to publish the survey, move over to [Bill Morrow's ThinkPad forums](http://forum.thinkpads.com/viewforum.php?f=74) and join the discussions over there!
