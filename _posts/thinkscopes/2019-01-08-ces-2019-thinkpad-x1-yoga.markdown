The ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 4's design will be completely overhauled in 2019, making it essentially a clean sheet design.

In the processor department, we will not see many improvements in regards to performance. We only expect some minor improvements with quad core processors available.

Memory is starts at 8GB and is configurable up to 16GB LPDDR3 and is soldered. No sockets are available.

Display options will remain the same. We will have 3 panels: 1x Full HD and 2x UHD (2560x1440). The regular FHD and UHD panels have a maximum brightness of 400 nits while the high-end UHD panel has a maximum brightness of 500 nits, 100% color gamut and is HDR and is Dolby Vision certified. An additional ePrivacy FHD panel is available.

At the bottom of the ThinkPad X1 Yoga, we will also find two sub-woofers, and the speaker system is Dolby Atmos certified.

Please note, that the ethernet dongle is not included with the ThinkPad X1 Yoga upon order and has to be bought separately. The Ethernet dongle by Lenovo allows native internet support as its connected to a Intel Ethernet Connection WHI219-LM. Currently there are two Ethernet dongles on the market to which we will refer as generation 1 and 2.

We're expecting blazing fast SSD speeds when PCIe NVMe is used. 4 lanes give a theoretical 32 Gb/s.

As for the dimensions, the new ThinkPad X1 Yoga is ~2 mm thinner at 15.25 mm. This is a reduction of roughly 11%. The rest of the machine is about 17% smaller. This brings that we will finally have smaller bezels, which allows us to retain the same amount of screen estate. This brings the weight at 1.36 kg or 2.9 pounds.

For the first time, we're seeing 'cnc machine aluminum' being used in a ThinkPad. No coating will be used on this material, similar to a Lenovo Yoga C930 or a MacBook. Because of the fact that no coating is used, the ThinkPad X1 Yoga will not be available in black at all. The official name for the new color is 'iron grey'. If you don't like this color, let us know in the comments how you feel about it.

The battery capacity of the ThinkPad X1 Yoga is reduced to 51 Wh, down from 54 Wh. Battery life is expected to be up to 14-15 hours,

The Lift-N-Lock keyboard is completely gone with the new ThinkPad X1 Yoga, to allow a smaller footprint. But either way, for those who are not familiar with the Yoga line, the keyboard disables in tablet mode, so it will not get in the way.

We will also find cat 16 LTE, which increases wireless speeds for WWAN. The WLAN module will feature [802.11ax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ax), which will greatly help in dense environments.

The ThinkPad X1 Yoga will include a mechanical docking port.
