Enabling GZIP compression for your website is important. Because it reduces the network bandwidth required to display a page. Your readers will thank you for not wasting any bytes in their data plan. In addition to that, pages will also load faster as a result, specially if you are using a slower connection.

Anyway some of you are already thinking of creating a '.htaccess' file, because that is what you used to do before you started using Azure right? '.htaccess' files are only found on Apache servers. Azure uses something different, called a **'web.config'** file.

# Requirements

  * Basic or Standard pricing plan: does not work on the 'Free' and 'Shared' hosting options.

# Instructions

  1. To find the **'web.config'** file, log in to your FTP server on Azure using FileZilla (or something similar).
  2. To find your login credentials for the FTP server, openÂ [Azure Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).
  3. At the Azure Portal, scroll down. You will find the login credentials there (with the exception of the password.

  4. Navigate to **'/site/wwwroot'**, there you will find the 'web.config' file & download it.

  5. To enable GZIP compression you need to add the lines marked below to your 'web.config' file. Then upload it back to to the FTP server using FileZilla.

# Notes

  * You cannot enable GZIP compression if you are using a 'FREE' or 'SHARED' plan to host your website on Azure. You need at least a 'BASIC' or 'STANDARD' plan.

And you have to admit, that **'web.config'** file looks way prettier than that messy **'.htaccess'** file you used to have with Apache!
