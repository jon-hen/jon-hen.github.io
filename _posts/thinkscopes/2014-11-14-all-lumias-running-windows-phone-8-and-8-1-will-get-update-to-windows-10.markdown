It was not long ago that Windows Phone 8 was released. Apparently none of the Windows Phones running Windows Phone 7 would get an update to Windows Phone 8 due to significant changes in the kernel. Microsoft received much criticism on this and has now learned from its mistakes. But sometimes it is necessary to make a sacrifice for the greater good.

Now that Microsoft is back on track, I have made a list of all Lumia's that wil receive an update to Windows 10:



  * Lumia 520

  * Lumia 525

  * Lumia 530

  * Lumia 535

  * Lumia 620

  * Lumia 625

  * Lumia 630

  * Lumia 635

  * Lumia 720

  * Lumia 730

  * Lumia 735

  * Lumia 820

  * Lumia 822

  * Lumia 830

  * Lumia 920

  * Lumia 925

  * Lumia 928

  * Lumia 929

  * Lumia 930

  * Lumia 1020

  * Lumia 1320

  * Lumia 1520


**Note:** Lumia's which are not yet released at 14th of November, the time of publishing this article, are not included. It is safe to assume thatÂ upcoming Lumia's will all receive the update to Windows 10.
