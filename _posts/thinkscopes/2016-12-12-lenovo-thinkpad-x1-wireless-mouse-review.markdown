The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Wireless Mouse is a luxury mouse that comes at a price. At the time of writing, it was being sold for 60$, which is well above the average price for a mouse. Now the question is how much do you need to pay for a mouse. You can easily pick up a mouse for less than 20$ and make it last several years. That is assuming the mouse wheel doesn't fail. From my experience, the mouse wheel is usually the first component to fail in a mouse. My first impressions of the ThinkPad X1 Wireless Mouse are very good, here is why.

## Ergonomics


The lack of a mouse wheel in the ThinkPad X1 Wireless Mouse could increase durability, but also decrease usability and user comfort. However, the ThinkPad X1 Wireless Mouse scores very high here.

This is not the first mouse I've used with a touch scrolling feature and strange ergonomics. Usually the combination of both made me not want to use those weirdly designed mouses.

Arc shaped mouses are one of those you may want to avoid, for the reason that they have 2 points that support them. Which makes moving your mouse feel uncomfortable and inaccurate. The bottom of the ThinkPad X1 Wireless mouse is more traditional, which is also the most comfortable to use. The mouse slides smoothly over the various surfaces I have tried.

Because of the ThinkPad X1 Wireless Mouse's flat shape, you won't be able to rest your hand completely on the body of the mouse. Therefore, it takes some time getting used to, as you'll have to get the right grip. To get the best grip, I put my thumb in the middle of the left side of the mouse. The thicker the mouse is where your thumb is positioned, the better your grip will be.

## Using the X1 Wireless Mouse


The first thing you'll have to do is browse to [http://www.lenovo.com/support/mice](http://www.lenovo.com/support/mice) and download the drivers for the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Wireless Mouse for Windows. Don't worry, the mouse will work without those drivers, although you won't have 100% of the functionality it is capable of.

The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Wireless mouse lacks a middle mouse button. Clicking the left mouse button and right mouse button is easy and more or less comfortable. I don't think you will have to worry about accidentally clicking things.

The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Wireless Mouse lacks a mouse wheel and uses touch gestures to scroll. To scroll, put your middle finger on the red line and slowly swipe towards the direction you'd like to scroll. Scrolling isn't as smoothly as I would have hoped but it works flawlessly. It also looks like Lenovo improved the touch scrolling which I really hate on the first generation Yoga Mouse. Accidentally scrolling became a habit on those, but this is definitely not the case on the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Wireless Mouse, which makes me very satisfied about owning it.

At the bottom we see two arrows, one pointing to the left and one pointing to the right. This appears to scroll one page up or down when you web browser open. These are linked to the 'Page Down' and 'Page Up' keys. This might be useful for presentations.

We also find a switch at the bottom to turn the mouse on or off. When we slide the bottom of the mouse forward, we find the storage for the USB dongle, a mouse mode switch (Bluetooth or dongle) and a USB port for charging purposes. The USB dongle magnetically locks in place to prevent parts breaking off getting the dongle out again.

## Battery


The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Wireless Mouse uses an integrated battery with a capacity of 380 mAh. The battery delivers up to 1 month of battery life depending on how much you use it. In case you happen to be running out of battery soon, there is a battery life indicator on the left side of the left mouse button. I assume the battery is also covered under the 1 year warranty for accessories.


## Presentations


When you hold the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Wireless Mouse upside down, you can use the two buttons to switch slides. The black surface below the white line and the two buttons can be used as a touchpad to move the mouse cursor during a presentation.


## Compatibility


It should be possible to get the ThinkPad X1 Wireless Mouse to work on Mac OSX and Linux with a little help from scripts.

## Verdict


The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Wireless Mouse comes at a high price of 49$-59$. The added functionality, low weight and dimensions greatly benefit those who are on the road and do many presentations with their clients or co-workers like myself. If you are looking to impress the people you work with or improve your mobile life with minimal or no sacrifice, then the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Wireless Mouse is something for you.
