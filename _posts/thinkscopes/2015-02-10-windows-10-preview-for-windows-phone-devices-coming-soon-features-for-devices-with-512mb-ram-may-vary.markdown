Good news for all owners of a Windows Phone with 512MB RAM like the Lumia 520, the Lumia 530, the Lumia 620, the Lumia 630 or the Lumia 720:

Although devices like the Lumia 520 are approximately two years old, Microsoft plans to release Windows 10 for these devices, too:


<blockquote>Hey all: we ARE working on Win10 for 512MB, including 520. Our ambition is to make [#Win10](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Win10?src=hash) available for these devices but features may vary

However, they probably won't get all the new features due to the low hardware specifications. Devices with 1GB RAM like the Lumia 820 or the Lumia 920 probably will support more features, but to use all features, you might have to get a flagship device like the Lumia 930 or its unannounced successor. Keep in mind that devices like the Lumia 520 can't even use all features of Windows Phone 8.1 and the Lumia Denim update.  Microsoft appears to have learned from the negative customer feedback at the time of the step from Windows Phone 7 to Windows Phone 8, where the older phones didn't get the new OS version There is however some "bad" news: Although the first preview build of Windows 10 for Windows Phone devices will be available [soon](https://twitter.com/joebelfiore/status/564537739849109504), not all devices will get the preview at the same time:

Timing for various phones may be variable as well. When we first launch insider program, it'll be a subset of phones with more coming latr — joebelfiore (@joebelfiore) [8. Februar 2015](https://twitter.com/joebelfiore/status/564537402975211520)
