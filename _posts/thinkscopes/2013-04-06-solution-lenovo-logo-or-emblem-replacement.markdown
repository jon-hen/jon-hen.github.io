Couple of my new ThinkPads have recently suffered some quality issues with the Lenovo logo located on the ThinkPad lid. Basically the 'e' on the Lenovo logo would come off, or gets damaged as it detaches from the underlying plastic base layer. This is both unsightly and can cause minor injuries in some cases, which i personally experienced and there have been others in the same boat ([http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/T400-T500-and-newer-T-series/Cut-myself-on-a-T420i/m-p/1074957#M77166](http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/T400-T500-and-newer-T-series/Cut-myself-on-a-T420i/m-p/1074957#M77166)).

## [Solution]


Lenovo have already implemented a new FRU for the replacement badge, which dealt with the detaching e issue and have circulated them into the warranty service inventory. So if you have this issue and is within warranty, you need to call up Lenovo service and ask about the replacement badge (CRU 04Y1931)
