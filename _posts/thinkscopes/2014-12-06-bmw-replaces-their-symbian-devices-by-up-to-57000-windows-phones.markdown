[According to the German website WParea.de](http://wparea.de/2014/12/neuer-geschaeftskunde-bmw-setzt-zukuenftig-auf-windows-phone/), the German automobile manufacturer [BMW](www.bmw.com/) plans to buy up to 57,000 Windows Phones for its employees to replace the outdated Symbian phones they use nowadays.

While the majority of the employees will recieve the low-end [Lumia 630](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/phone/lumia630/), the management will recieve the [Lumia 920](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/phone/lumia920/) respectively the newer Lumia 930.

The announcement was made by the workers' council after its meeting on Tuesday.

I hope that other companies, especially in the automotive industry, follow the example of BMW soon, because I think it's very important that more enterprise customers use Windows Phone than nowadays. On the other hand, Microsoft should improve Windows Phone - especially Office Mobile - further to make it more attractive for enterprise customers.

What do you think about the announcement of BMW? Would you have suggested BMW to buy Android or iOS devices instead? Feel free to comment below.
