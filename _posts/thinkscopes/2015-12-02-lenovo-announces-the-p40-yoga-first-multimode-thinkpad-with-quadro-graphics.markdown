[![P40 Yoga Hero](/assets/img/posts/thinkscopes/2015/12/P40-Yoga-Hero2.jpg)](/assets/img/posts/thinkscopes/2015/12/P40-Yoga-Hero2.jpg)

Today Lenovo announced a new addition to its lineup of Mobile Workstations, which now resides under the new name "ThinkPad P-Series" (replacing the W-Series) - the new **ThinkPad P40 Yoga**.

This machine is based on Intels Skylake plattform, utilising 15W Skylake-U Core i5 and i7 processors. The chassis is build on the robust base of the ThinkPad Yoga 460, which was introduced at IFA 2015 (which also includes fulfilling the Military Testing, the first of any ThinkPad Yoga). The chassis is made out of Magnesium and Carbon fiber.

The main benefit here, that really transforms this one into more of a workstation machine: The Quadro GPU chip thats inside every P40 Yoga, as it is ISV certified. The GPU in here is the M500M, a video chip of nVidias newest Maxwell Quadro generation.

The P40 Yoga is part of a big push of penenabled ThinkPads. As with all the other penenabled Skylake ThinkPads, it utilizes a Wacom digitizer pen, which is based on Wacoms Active Pen technology (Wacom AES, Active Electrostatical Solution). You may be familiar with older ThinkPad penenabled devices and notice that these always used Wacoms EMR technique (EMR means Electromagnetic Resonance). In fact, this technology was used on ThinkPad X-Series tablets since 2005, since the X41 Tablet, the first modern ThinkPad Tablet device. What are the advantages and disadvantages of EMR vs. AES?



  * EMR Pens don´t need batteries, AES pens do

  * With AES, you can build a thinner display

  * AES is more accurate on the edge of the display

  * AES is cheaper and provides the device with a slightly longer battery life


The pen has 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity, and Lenovo told us the worked with Wacom to perfect accuracy and the pen performance in general. With the power of the pen and the Quadro M500M GPU
