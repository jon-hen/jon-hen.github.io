title: Why ThinkPad X1 Carbon doesn't use barrel type connector?

### If you are the type of person whom owns many ThinkPads like me, you would have countless traditional Lenovo ThinkPad 'barrel' type power adapter. So if you are in the position of buying the X1 Carbon, non of your ThinkPad power adapter could be used, which is a great waste of available resources (ahem...).




### But after much ranting and shouting at the top of your lung at how bad Lenovo is (and how inconsiderate they are to the Lenovo customers), there is actually a real reason why such power adapter would need to be used.




### Basically, the flat rectangular connector type is used on the X1 Carbon so that Lenovo could achieve the required thinness on the ThinkPad X1 Carbon.




### The old ThinkPad barrel connector has a diameter of 7.97 mm, while the X1 Carbon connector has a breadth of 4.53 mm, while the X1 Carbon thickness at the side stands at 10.74 mm.

### While, Lenovo could effectively put the barrel connector type into the X1 Carbon and used no reinforcement at all, but this would make the ThinkPad X1 Carbon power connection extremely fragile. As such Apple was really wise in using the magnetic type connection (and shape) for its MagSafe power adapter, as this sort of design allowed itself to be easily adapted to ultra thin Macbook Air. In addition, Lenovo's power connector design draw power from the inner barrel and outside barrel, which means there are difficulties in reducing the diameter of the jack and fit everything into the X1 Carbon body.
