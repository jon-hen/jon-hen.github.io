If you are like me whom is using the ThinkPad Tablet 2 everyday, then most likely you may have been frustrated by the slow charging speed of the TPT2 battery when it is completely switched off, which usually takes around 8 hours to fully charge the battery from 5% to around 95%. So what do you do?


## Solution 1:


Get the ThinkPad Tablet 2 dock, which charges your TPT2 battery using the ThinkPad 65 watts adapter, it would charge your battery from flat to full in about 60 to 90 minutes time. But this dock costs around $100 USD, which is quite expensive if all you are doing is charging your battery, and you are not using the other features like HDMI, ethernet and the extra USB ports. 


## **Solution 2 (Free solution):**


Charge your ThinkPad Tablet 2 using the supplied 10 Watts power adapter, but instead of switching your TPT2 completely off, leave the laptop in sleep mode and charge the laptop. For some reason, when the TPT2 is completely switched off, the device would only trickle charge the battery. Whilst it is in sleep mode, the TPT2 device would draw a higher current from the USB power adapter, which allows you to fully charge the TPT2 battery within 3 hours. Whilst this method won't charge your TPT2 battery as fast as the dock would, it is a pretty work around to your slow trickle charge problem.
