**Price:** $29 AUD

**Score:** 5/10

**Pros:**

-Dedicated media key

-Good quality construction

-Short key travel

**Cons:**

-Not very comfortable to type on

-The keys feel a little mushy

-The keyboard curvature and short travel key takes sometime to get use to

**Verdict:**

An okay keyboard for the price, but i personally would pay the extra money to get the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 keyboard, which is a far better keyboard in both comfort and key feel.

# Review


I got this keyboard about 3 years ago because there was a special promotion going on with Microsoft Cashback offer (which i forgot to redeem because i lost the receipt), and i thought it would be pretty sweet to get this Comfort Curve keyboard for only 20 dollars. I took this keyboard home and started using it, the initial impression was that this keyboard was poorly designed in terms of ergonomics and curvature of the keyboard. These design problems were further exacerbated by the weird and mushy key feel, which makes it one of the worst Microsoft keyboard that i have ever used.

Also, i have only ever used this keyboard 10 times in the last 3 years or so, and the V key for some reason doesn’t work, so now it just sits there collecting dusts.


# Conclusion


There are far better Microsoft keyboard keyboards out there, and i don’t recommend anyone to purchase this keyboard if they are serious typists.
