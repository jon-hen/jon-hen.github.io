In October's update for the Lenovo Yoga Book with Android. Users have now received support for the ExFAT filesystem, allowing files bigger than 2GB. This is probably in the wake of Lenovo announcing the new Yoga Book 2.0 with more storage capacity, turning your Yoga Book into a media entertainment system.

The build number of this version is LenovoYB1-X90F_S1000183_171013.

Some users are still reporting battery drain on Android Nougat. The current solution for this is to reset the order of the quick setting tiles in the notification area.

  1. Drag down the status bar.
  2. Pre-512x288ss the third icon from the right side that looks like a pen with squares behind it.
  3. Now on the top right, you should be able to see a button that says 'Reset'.

If this does not solve your battery issues, check your installed apps for compatibility issues with Android Nougat.
