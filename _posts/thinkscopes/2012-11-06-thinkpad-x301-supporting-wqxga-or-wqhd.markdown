So one of those people whom still have their ThinkPad X301 and want to use the onboard displayport for connecting to LCD greater than single link DVI resolution (i.e. 1920x1200).

The good news is that the ThinkPad X301 can support 27 inch (WQHD 2560 x 1440) and 30 inch (WQXGA 2560 x 1600), which are dual link dvi resolution at 60 hz.

I have connected my ThinkPad X301 to an iMac 27 inch using a Displayport to Mini Displayport connector from Lenovo, and also connected to my Dell U2711 and U2713.
