**Update:** ThinkPad 13 Specs are now available!

The ThinkPad brand consists of very diverse, very different products. There are not only expensive high-end models. There are also ThinkPad models tailor made for people who don´t have that much money to spend on a PC, but still want parts of the ThinkPad experience. Thats why the **ThinkPad L-Series** and the new **ThinkPad 13** exist.


## L460 & L560: The affordable business ThinkPads


If the ThinkPad E-Series is the affordable series for small businesses and consumers, the L-Series is the affordable series for big enterprise and education. Offering features like a traditional mechanical dockingport, a smartcard reader or security features like TPM or a fingerprint sensor is important for this segment of the PC market. Thats also why the newest entries into the L-Series, the **L460** and the **L560 **are the only two ThinkPads left with an **analog VGA port**. All other models have moved past this port with this generation of ThinkPads, but it seems it was important for Lenovo to continue offering universities, schools and big companies with existing VGA infrastructure an option to keep this infrastructure intact for a few years. Its also a nice option for students who don´t want to carry a VGA adapter all the time.

While the L-Series offers all the important business connective and security features, the chassis is the area where the L-Series is saving most of the money. Unlike the T-Series, the entire chassis is made out of ordinary ABS plastics, only reinforced with thin metal sheets. Still, all L-Series models pass the military 810G standard for toughness testing. Chassis wise, the **L460 is a direct update of the exisiting L450 plattform**, no big changes there. **L560** however, had **a new chassis**. Gone is the buttonsless trackpad of the L540, the TrackPoint buttons are returned in their full glory. Also, it is in general besides the P50 the only 15" model that **hasn´t gone the Ultrabook route**, with no internal battery and even legacy feature like **an Expresscard slot** and **an ODD** left in place, which means its an important legacy option for buyers who still need these features. In terms of design, its also the only model besides P50 and P70 that still has the more traditional **top-mounted hinges** instead of drop-down hinges like the rest of the lineup. Of course having a chassis like this showes whn it comes to the weight - L560 is starting at 2.3 kg, and it is 27.6 mm thick.

Screens: L460 has the same screen options as the L450. L560 however swaps out the FHD TN screen used in the L540 for a **1920x1080 (FHD) IPS** screen, being the first 15.6" L model to sport such a screen.

Normally there are only two L-Series models every year. Last year however we had a special situation: We had L440, L540 and L450. This situation occoured because Intel did not offer high-voltage CPUs in their Broadwell CPU generation. Thats why Lenovo simply continued to offer L440 and L540, and introduced L450 as a 3rd option. Unlike the L440, which used full-voltage M CPUs, L450 was based on low-voltage U CPUs. It didn´t qualify as an Ultrabook, Lenovo simply called it a "Thinbook" internally. Now it all comes full circle, with the new generation of L-Series all sporting **6th generation Core i U CPUs (Low Voltage)**. L560 too, despite having a classical Notebook chassis, is now based on Ultrabook type CPUs.

## ThinkPad 13: The affordable education ThinkPad


![ThinkPad 13_1](/assets/img/posts/thinkscopes/2016/01/ThinkPad-13_1-512x172.jpg)

This new entrance to the ThinkPad lineup is interesting for multiple reasons. The ThinkPad 13 fills the gap Lenovo left when they discontinued the 13" ThinkPad Edge E-Series in 2013. Although the X260 covers a similar market segment (students), its has one problem: Its simply too expensive for many students. ThinkPad 13 is designed to be affordable, without being fragile, since its also passing Mil-Specs. ThinkPad 13 offers a USB Type C port, as well as HDMI, three USB 3.0 ports, a Onelink+ port and a SD card reader. ThinkPad 13 is available with ChromeOS or Windows, and the Windows model is available with SSD option and up to 16 GB RAM. Unlike the Thinkpad 11e, which is also targeting the educational market, the Thinkpad 13 thankfully includes a TrackPoint.
