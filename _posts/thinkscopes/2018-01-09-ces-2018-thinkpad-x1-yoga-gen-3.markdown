Not many new features with the Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga Gen 3. We're primarily seeing the same changes as with the [ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 6](/blog/2018/01/09/ces-2018-x1-carbon-gen-6/), introducing the ThinkShutter and the 15W quad core processors.

Aside from that, the OLED display is no longer available. This could be due to the reliability of the OLED technology. Consider this, if you buy a machine for professional use, you will use it 8 hours per day and 5 times per week. Most companies in Europe throw their machines away after 2-3 years. That being said, the color accuracy and brightness could change a lot over its lifespan. Or simply put, the lack of demand for the high price could also have brought Lenovo to this decision.

However, instead, we will see the high brightness 500-nit display offered in the new [ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 6](/blog/2018/01/09/ces-2018-x1-carbon-gen-6/). The battery life of the 500-nit panel is the same as the 300-nit panel due to various improvements made.



The graphics card is the Intel UHD 620. It is about 100MHz faster than the Intel HD 620.

The camera is a 720p camera which is slightly less than 1 MP, and is not as good as the front camera found on the [ThinkPad X1 Tablet Gen 3 (2018)](/blog/2018/01/09/ces-2018-thinkpad-x1-tablet-gen-3/). There is an available IR camera for facial recognition.

The ThinkPad X1 Yoga 3 has soldered LPDDR3 2133 MHz RAM running in dual channel mode.

The battery is a 54Wh battery, down from 56Wh. However, battery life is only 0.5 hours lower at 15 hours. The ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 3 still features RapidCharge. You'll be able to charge your X1 Yoga Gen 3 with a 65W USB-C AC adapter.
