**Review**

I am an avid collectors of different desktop keyboard, whom is trying to find his own piece of keyboard heaven amongst the clutters of various consumer grade keyboards that are in existence. While i haven't found the perfect keyboard yet, but i have to say that the Apple compact wired keyboard is very good in terms of tactility, portability and quality.

However, the compact wired keyboard does have 2 USB ports underneath like the full sized wired keyboard, which is really handy and something i constantly use.

This tactility is missing from the bluetooth version, even though they have the same key layout, as such the tactility of the wired version must derive from the increased stiffness and weight of the base plate.

This keyboard is great for use when travelling, especially on a Macbook Pro or Air. When used in the windows environment, the lack of Delete key and shortcuts for multimedia controls are something you have to get use to, but it is not that of a problem. If you want to get one of these keyboards, you probably need to head to ebay and Amazon to get them, as Apple no longer produces them or sell them. Also, in Windows environment the USB ports on the keyboard wi-300x83ll only operate in USB 1.1 mode.
