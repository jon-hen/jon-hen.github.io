Although the focus of this blog is more on the products of Lenovo, information about the financial situation of lenovo should not be neglected:

On Tuesday, Lenovo announced the results for its **third fiscal quarter **that ended December 31, 2014.

They achieved a quarterly revenue of **US$ 14.1 billion**, which is a 31 percent increase year-over-year.

Lenovo had a pre-tax income before non-cash, M&A (Mergers & Acquisitions)-related accounting charges of **US$348 million** and a pre-tax income of **US$274 million**. While the former was 8 percent more compared to the third fiscal quarter of the previous year, the latter went down by 15% due to charges such as intangible asset amortization and interest on promissory notes caused by the Motorola and System x investments.

While having sold **its 100 millionth ThinkPad**, Lenovo achieved a total PC market share of 20 percent in the last quarter.

The Motorola and System x investments increased the balance: The PC business group now accounts for 65 percent of the revenue, while the Mobile business group delivers 24 percent and the Enterprise business group contributes 9 percent.
