Do you have an idea for an app, but you don't know how to realize it due to your insufficient coding skills? If you plan to develop an app for Windows or Windows Phone, there is a solution for you: [Windows App Studio](http://appstudio.windows.com/en-us)

It's "[a] **free**, **online** app creation tool that allows you to **quickly** build Windows and Windows Phone apps to publish, test, and share." (quotation from [http://appstudio.windows.com/en-us](http://appstudio.windows.com/en-us))

According to a [blog post by Microsoft](http://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2014/11/25/windows-app-studio-adds-twitter-and-instagram-oauth-integration/), there have been two features added today:



  * You're now able to integrate a Twitter Data source which enables you to show your own user account timeline, to show another user’s timeline or to display a hashtag’s search results. In order to do so, you have to use Twitter access tokens you can get from [https://apps.twitter.com/](https://apps.twitter.com/).

  *  The Instagram Data Source has been updated to comply with the Instagram standards for third-party apps.


If you need any further information how to implement the new features, please refer to the [How to](http://appstudio.windows.com/en-us/home/howto) Microsoft provides.

We'd like to see your apps in the Store soon! Please feel free to comment below about your experience with Windows App Studio!
