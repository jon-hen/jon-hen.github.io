ThinkPad X1 Android/Windows OS Hybrid is coming to town!

Well the release ThinkPad X1 is announced by Lenovo to channel partners quite a while ago in their roadshows, but now it is officially announced to the public through various IT news site around the world. From what is said in the channel partner event couple of months ago, the new X1 Hybrid will have same specification as the old ThinkPad X1, the only real difference is that it will have the Android installed alongside the regular Windows 7 Operating System. Basically you will be able to boot into either the Windows OS or the Android, depending on your need. Some people may ask why have the Android in the ThinkPad X1? From all the marketing materials handed out to the public, it seems that when using the Android alone the battery life of the ThinkPad X1 can be stretched out to 10 hours, which basically doubles the standard battery life of the ThinkPad X1 when operating on the Windows OS. So basically battery life is one of the reason why ThinkPad X1 hybrid exists, also the novelty factor of having Android on a laptop that also runs Windows OS may interest certain consumer demographic. This maybe the mid life upgrade that the ThinkPad X1 needs to continue its sale momentum.

P.S. The ThinkPad X1 Hybrid would get 20 hours battery life with the extra battery attached to the base?
