Currently all ThinkPads with mSATA slot utilises the SATAII 3.0 G/s specification, regardless of the main hdd SATA specification, or if your mSATA drive is SATAIII capable. The following benchmark illustrates this point, i put a SATAIII capable mSATA into the T430u's mSATA slot, which is only SATAII capable, and the benchmark shows that the mSATA in the ThinkPad mSATA slot is only SATAII capable.
