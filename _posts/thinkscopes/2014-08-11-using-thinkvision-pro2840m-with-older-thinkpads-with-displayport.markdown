If you have an older ThinkPad with displayport, such as:



  * ThinkPad X200 (with dock)

  * ThinkPad X200s (with dock)

  * ThinkPad X200t (with dock)

  * ThinkPad X201 (with dock)

  * ThinkPad X201s (with dock)

  * ThinkPad X201t (with dock)

  * ThinkPad T500

  * ThinkPad R500

  * ThinkPad W500

  * ThinkPad W700 and ThinkPad W700ds

  * ThinkPad X301


These machines may not work correctly with the new ThinkVision Pro2840m when it is in the Displayport (DP) 1.2 mode. Usually, the external ThinkVision Pro2840m is either not detected by these old ThinkPad (i.e. ThinkPad X201), or it may cause the ThinkPad to crash (i.e. ThinkPad X301). In these cases, you have to switch the ThinkVision Pro2840m to DP 1.1 mode under the screen option menu. After this, your ThinkVision Pro2840m would work these older ThinkPad with displayport, either at its native 4K resolution or its reduced resolution of 2560x1600 (i.e. ThinkPad X301). However, do remember when you switch your ThinkVision Pro2840m to the DP 1.1 mode, your LCD would only operate at 30 hz max.
