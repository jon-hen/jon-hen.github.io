Lenovo is about to release their first 30 inch ThinkVision LCD (LT3035p Wide) to the worldwide market. According to the information available on the web, it will have the following specifications:

So basically, the ThinkVision LT3053p Wide will use an AH-IPS LCD panel, which is similar to the LCD panel type fitted into the Dell U2713m. Also, like the Dell U2713hm LCD, the new ThinkVision LT3053p Wide will use a white LED backlight, rather than the more common Wide-CCFL which many 30 inches professional LCD uses in the past. The LED backlight allows the ThinkVision LT3053p to be more energy efficient, and allows it to last longer than the W-CCFL counterpart.

The LT3053p will have:



  * 99% Adobe RGB

  * 350 nits brightness

  * 2560x1600 resolution

  * 1000:1 contrast ratio

  * 178 degrees viewing angle for horizontal and vertical

  * 6 ms G2G response time

  * 88 watts average power consumption, and maximum of 130 watts when the screen brightness is at 100%, and all the USB ports are drawing full power.

  * 2 x USB 2.0 ports

  * 2 x USB 3.0 ports

  * 1 x USB Always On ports (so you can use them even when the LCD is switched off).

  * 1 x VGA port

  * 1 x DVI-D Dual Link Port (HDCP compliant)

  * 1 x Displayport 1.2 (HDCP compliant)

  * 1 x HDMI 1.4 (HDCP compliant)

  * **1 x Mobile High Definition Link (MHL) port**

  * VESA mounting hole

  * Kensington security lock compatible

  * **It also supports Daisychain on the Displayport connection (so you can theoretically connect two LT3053p through one displayport 1.2). **

  * Shading hood

**There is also full range of tilt, swivel, pivot and height adjustment (expected in monitor of this category).**

One of the most interesting feature to be included on the ThinkVision LT3053p is this MHL port, which is type of data/video/audio interface used on mobile devices like phones and tablets. It is basically similar to HDMI but it also supports charging of mobile devices like a USB port does. The use of MHL port on a 30 inch professional monitor is quite interesting, since the resolution of this port is limited to only FHD 1920 x 1080. But the inclusion of the MHL port in the ThinkVision monitor shows the direction in which Lenovo mobile business is heading towards, and they are serious about integrating their phone/tablet into the Lenovo product ecosystem.

**Finally, Lenovo have set the price of the LT3053p ThinkVision monitor in the $1600 USD region.**
