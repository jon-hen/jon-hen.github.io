# First Impressions


The image quality isn't the best there is, but it is exactly what you would expect in its price category and class. I paid about 140 EUR including international shipping in Europe.

The contrast is a bit low. But I am not complaining. If you want good color accuracy DisplayLink isn't a technology you should go with, because there is no color calibration. With these portable monitors, the competition also uses TN-panels, you will have to try very hard to find a IPS-panel to get satisfying results. They chose for TN-panels because it consumes less power than an IPS-panel (15% less power on average). However if you want great display quality, the ThinkVision LT1423p is currently the best portable monitor at the moment.

There are no reflections at all on the display, and you can still work decently outdoors despite the lower brightness.

[![No glare](](/assets/img/posts/thinkscopes/2014/10/WP_20141021_14_26_29_web.jpg)](](/assets/img/posts/thinkscopes/2014/10/WP_20141021_14_26_29_web.jpg) No glare

The build quality is quite good and you shouldn't worry about the ThinkVision LT1421 bending in your backpack. Its cover will also protect the display panel against scratches when you are not using it. The materials used is plastic and isn't very scratch resistant because of it.

The LT1421 weighs 1.02kg and is quite light and will not slow you down. It is the perfect addon to your work tools on the go, at work, at home.

The installation went very smoothy when I connected it to my X1 Carbon (20A7) running Windows 8.1, it will work out of the box after it has downloaded the driver from Windows Update.

Pro:



  * Weight

  * Price

  * Build Quality

  * Features

  * Easy to use

  * Excellent support


Con:

  * TN-panel




# Installation




## Windows 8.1


Just plug your monitor in, and it will start installing drivers. If Windows has trouble downloading the drivers from Windows Update, you can always download them from [www.displaylink.com](http://www.displaylink.com/support/downloads.php).


# FAQ





  * **Is color calibration supported?**
No, this is currently a limitation with DisplayLink.

  * **Can you scale the monitor independently from the primary display in Windows 8.1?**
It appears that this is not possible.
