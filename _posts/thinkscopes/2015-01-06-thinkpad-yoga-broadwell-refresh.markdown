Actually there was one part of the ThinkPad lineup missing in yesterday's announcement: The new ThinkPad Yoga. Although we did catch a glimpse of these new ThinkPad Yoga devices in the background of some hands-on videos of T450/T550, they were left out in the actual press release. It turned out that their announcement coincided with the new Lenovo Yoga release announcement.

There were two refreshed products, and one completely new product in the ThinkPad Yoga lineup.

The first ThinkPad Yoga announced in the CES 2015 was the refresh of the original 12.5" ThinkPad Yoga. It looked almost identical to the original ThinkPad Yoga, with the exception of the added TrackPoint-buttons of course. So this is really the original ThinkPad Yoga with a better Broadwell CPU and the addition of TrackPoint buttons (and i think it is perfect). The specs:



  * 5th Gen Intel Core i CPUs

  * Intel HD 5500

  * 12.5" FHD 1920x1080 IPS screen (400nits), 10-point Multitouch, Antiglare (Digitizer) or Glossy, 1366x768 IPS (300nits), 10-point Multitouch, Glossy

  * 4 - 8 GB DDR3L RAM, soldered

  * 2.5″ 9.5mm SATA 3 HDD (up to 1 TB), SSHD (500 GB + 8 GB SSD) or SSD, plus a 42mm M.2 SSD

  * 2x USB 3.0, mini-HDMI, Combo-Headphone/Mic Port, SD-Card Reader, 720p webcam, OneLink docking port, Fingerprint reader (optional)

  * Bluetooth 4.0; WiFi combo card

  * 6-Rows backlit ThinkPad Precision keyboard, New 2015 UltraNav ("3 + 2 button ClickPad") with dedicated TrackPoint buttons, Lift&Lock keyboard

  * 48 Wh battery, internal

  * 316 x 221 x 18.8 mm, starting at 1.58 kg

  * Availability: February 2015

Next is the Broadwell refresh of the ThinkPad Yoga 14 that was announced in October (see my article: ![](/blog/2014/10/11/thinkpad-yoga-14-announced/)), now with TrackPoint buttons and an "Active Digitizer" - though I don't know what that means yet. It doesn't seem to be the same digitizer as in the ThinkPad Yoga 12, but I guess we will find that out soon (Jin: the new digitiser pen for Yoga 14 and 15 uses AAAA battery like . The specs:

  * 5th Gen Intel Core i CPUs

  * Intel HD 5500 or/and nVidia GeForce GT 840M

  * 14" FHD 1920x1080 IPS screen (300nits), 10-point Multitouch, "Active Digitizer"

  * 4 - 8 GB DDR3L RAM, one SO-DIMM slot

  * 2.5″ 9.5mm SATA 3 HDD (up to 1 TB), SSHD (500 GB + 8 GB SSD) or SSD, plus a 42mm M.2 SSD

  * Availability: May 2015

  * Price: Starting at 1199 $


The last one is the only entirely new one - well, not entirely, its is based on the design of the ThinkPad Yoga 14. I am talking about the ThinkPad Yoga 15, the first 15.6" Yoga ever, and also the first 15.6" ThinkPad Convertible ever (and the first 15.6" ThinkPad with an FHD IPS screen). It also comes with the "Active Digitizer" seen on the Yoga 14 model (the digitiser is not compatible with 12.5 inches model), and it as some nice features beyond that as well - lets look at the specs:

  * 5th Gen Intel Core i CPUs

  * Intel HD 5500 or/and nVidia GeForce GT 840M

  * 15.6" FHD 1920x1080 IPS screen (300nits), 10-point Multitouch, "Active Digitizer"

  * 383 x 257 x 22 mm, starting at 2.3 kg

  * Availability: February 2015

  * Price: Starting at 1199 $
