There are plenty of budget smartphones at your disposal. But which one is actually the best? My experience with Android isn't really positive then talking about budget smartphones. They run quite slow and hang half of the time.

Microsoft nailed it with the Microsoft Lumia 535. A budget smartphone running Windows Phone 8.1 which might possibly get an update to Windows 10. And for a low price of 135 USD or 110 EUR you can't go really wrong with the Lumia 535.

Look at the specifications below.

Android smartphones that come with 512MB or 1GB of RAM have a very limited lifespan. Specially those which come with 512MB of RAM. They are meant to be thrown away within the same year of purchase. They are simply so slow because they have used up all their RAM.

Windows Phone is much more low-end friendly than Android. When I had my Lumia 625 6 months ago. I thought I still had a fast smartphone only paying 160 EUR. It had a dual core and 512MB of RAM. Try those specifications with Android, and it takes only a few seconds to decide.

You get a 5MP front camera with the Lumia 535. Excellent to take selfies on a budget. The average smartphone I know doesn't have a better front camera than 1.3MP. I can only think of smartphones past the 300 mark that offer such a good front camera resolution. But whether the quality of the images will be great is something we have to wait for.

Plus you may not forget you will get 15GB OneDrive storage for free, a built-in GPS (HERE Drive+) with offline maps support. Offline maps support with Android rarely works because it requires 2G or 3G connectivity. With Windows Phone you can sleep well without worries. You won't need 2G or 3G at all to use GPS navigation.

The only catch is that the Lumia 535 might not be coming to Europe or the U.S. according to Windows Central. So we have to wait and see and keep our fingers crossed.
