If you have ThinkPad W530, T530, T430, T430s, X230, X230t, you can interchange your non-backlit keyboard with the backlit version of the keyboard in your preferred language format.

Backlit and Non-backlit version uses the same connector, therefore they can be interchanged without any problem. Also, the W530, T430, T430s, T530, X230, and X230t shares the same keyboard, so they are interchangeable with each other.

A list of available keyboard options and their FRU can be found in service parts manual like this:

### Note: Although L430 and L530 uses the same Precision Keyboard as the other ThinkPad Classic machines like X230t, X230, T430, T430s, T530, and W530; they however do not support the backlit function of the Precision chiclet keyboard.
