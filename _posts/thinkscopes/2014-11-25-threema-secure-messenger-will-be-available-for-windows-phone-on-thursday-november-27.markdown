According to a tweet by the [Threema](https://threema.ch/en) team itself, the long-awaited secure messaging app will be available for Windows Phone this Thursday:


<blockquote>Hooray! Threema for [#WindowsPhone](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WindowsPhone?src=hash) will be released this Thursday Nov. 27. In celebration the first 10K users will get Threema at half-price!

The "mobile messaging app that puts security first" is already available for Android and iOS. According to Threema, its messaging app features "true end-to-end encryption", so your messages seem to be secure. I'd trust Threema more than other messaging apps because the "servers are located in Switzerland" and "[t]he software is developed exclusively in Switzerland", but it could be possible that there is a kind of keylogger in your mobile operating system, so you shouldn't expect 100% of security even if there is no possibility for third parties to access the messages from the Threema servers.

Which mobile messaging app do you use? Is secure messaging important for you? Would you pay for a secure messaging app, as you have to do to get Threema?
