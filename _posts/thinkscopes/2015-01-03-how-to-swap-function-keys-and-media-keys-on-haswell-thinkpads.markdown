If you have a ThinkPad released 2013 and onwards, you may have noticed you have to press the **Fn-key** every time to use a **function key (F1 - F12)**. Some people, e prefer to use the function keys above the media keys, and here is the solution to your problem.

Pressing **Fn + Esc** toggles Fn-Lock, which allows you to use the function keys without having to press the Fn-key every time. Press Fn + Esc again to undo this.

Applies to these Lenovo ThinkPad models:



  * E431 / E531, E440 / E540, E555

  * L440/L540

  * S431 / S531, S440 / S540

  * T431s, T440(p/s), T540p
