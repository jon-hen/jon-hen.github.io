title: A little, but important UEFI update for the X240, X240s and X250

Some weeks ago, Lenovo published an UEFI update for the ThinkPad X240 and ThinkPad X250.

Before the release of this update, the keyboard of these ThinkPads had a big disadvantage regarding the combined End/Insert key: when Fn lock was activated, you had to press Fn in order to use "End". It was really annoying for me because I use Home/End and PgUp/PageDown often to navigate and I have Fn lock activated, so I resulted in pressing "Insert" accidentaly often because I wasn't used to it. Luckily, the new update resolved that problem: now, independent from the Fn lock state, you have to press Fn to use "Insert".

The other reason why you shouldn't hesitate to install this update: it mitigates "the risk of security vulnerability related to [DRAM Row Hammering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer)".
