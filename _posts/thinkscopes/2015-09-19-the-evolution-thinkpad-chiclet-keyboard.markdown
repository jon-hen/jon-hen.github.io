In this short article, I want to take a look at how the ThinkPad Chiclet keyboard has evolved over time, since the initial announcement in 2010, over the introduction to mainstream ThinkPads in 2012, until today (2015) and the future generation (Skylake, 2016), which we already got a peek on with the new ThinkPad P series and the new Yoga 260.


## 2010 - First gen: X100e/X120e and EDGE (Gen 1)

As we can see, the evolution of the ThinkPad chiclet keyboard continues. Lenovo will continue to incorporate more customer feedback as I have been told on IFA, and even if they won´t bring back the 7 row layout for the mainstream ThinkPads (retro ThinkPad aside), the chiclet keyboards will only get better in the future.
