The ThinkPad L380 Yoga is a completely new model. The ThinkPad Yoga 370 is now moved to the X-series, and will be renamed to [ThinkPad X380 Yoga](/blog/2018/01/13/ces-2018-thinkpad-x380-yoga/). The difference here could be first of all the build quality and the materials used.

The L-series use in general plastic, whereas the X-series use magnesium-aluminum alloy or carbon fiber reinforced plastic. The material in the X-series depends on the color black or grey.

The ThinkPad L380 Yoga is heavier than the [ThinkPad X380 Yoga](/blog/2018/01/13/ces-2018-thinkpad-x380-yoga/), but has a few significant advantages, such as being upgradeable up to 32GB RAM having two SODIMM slots.

## ThinkPad L380 Yoga


Since the ThinkPad L380 Yoga is a budget ThinkPad Yoga, we're not expecting any discrete graphics. It comes with Intel HD Graphics 620. The memory is removable. You can install up to 32GB DDR4 2400MHz.

There are no 2.5" drives available, only PCIe SSD.

The webcam is unclear. I think there are two choices, an IR camera and a regular 720p camera, but no options for ThinkShutter. The display is a Full HD IPS matte touch screen.

Battery life is decent at up to 12 hours. There are two AC adapters available, a 45W adapter and 65W adapter. Both are USB-C.

I/O Ports:



 	
  * 2x USB 3.0 Type-C

 	
  * 3x USB 3.0

 	
  * HDMI
