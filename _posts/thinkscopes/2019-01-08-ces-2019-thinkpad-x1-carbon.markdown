The ThinkPad X1 Carbon's design will get some minor changes in 2019.

In the processor department, we are not expecting many changes as we believe Intel has already played their card. Quad core models will be available.

Memory is starts at 8GB and is configurable up to 16GB DDR4 and is soldered. No sockets are available. If you need more RAM, I'd suggest looking at the ThinkPad X1 Extreme, which is like the name suggests.

3 panels will be available: 1x Full HD and 2x UHD (2560x1440). The regular FHD and UHD panels have a maximum brightness of 400 nits while the high-end UHD panel has a maximum brightness of 500 nits, 100% color gamut and is HDR and is Dolby Vision certified. There is an additional FHD panel which supports ePrivacy.

ThinkShutter is now also available on all camera's, including the IR ones for Windows Hello.

At the bottom, we will also find two sub-woofers, and the speaker system is Dolby Atmos certified.

Please note, that the Ethernet dongle is not included upon order and has to be bought separately. The Ethernet dongle by Lenovo allows native internet support as its connected to a Intel Ethernet Connection WHI219-LM. Currently there are two Ethernet dongles on the market to which we will refer as generation 1 and 2.

We're expecting blazing fast SSD speeds when PCIe NVMe is used. 4 lanes give a theoretical 32 Gb/s.

As for the dimensions, the new ThinkPad X1 Carbon is 1 mm thinner at 14.9 mm. This is a reduction of roughly 6%. The rest of the machine is about 17% smaller. This brings that we will finally have smaller bezels, which allows us to retain the same amount of screen estate. The weight is only 1.12 kg or 2.4 pounds.

As with the ThinkPad X1 Yoga, it will have 'cnc machine aluminum'. No silver options will be available. You will now also have the option for a carbon-fiber woven lid.

We also have cat 16 WWAN and [802.11ax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ax) WLAN.

The battery capacity is reduced to 51 Wh, down from 54 Wh. Battery life is expected to be up to 14-15 hours.
