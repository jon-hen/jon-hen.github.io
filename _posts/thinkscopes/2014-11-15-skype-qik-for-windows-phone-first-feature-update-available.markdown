About a month ago, Microsoft published [Skype Qik](http://www.skype.com/en/qik/), a "new mobile messenger for swapping videos with groups of friends", which is available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skype.android.qik), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype-qik/id893994044) and [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/skype-qik/e145af3f-2aab-4e78-8699-ce948e26d27f). Unfortunately, none of my contacts uses Skype Qik yet, so I don't have any personal experience with this app.

Although, the first feature update (version _1.2.1.158_) for Windows Phone has been published today. The main change is the implementation of a feature, called "Qik Flik", that was already available for Android and iOS users before. With _Qik Flik_, you can record short videos with a duration of five seconds that you can share later with your contacts.
In my opinion, it's a shame that Qik Flik was available for Android and iOS weeks before it came to Windows Phone, but the poor market share of Windows Phone might be a reason.

Do you use _Skype Qik_? Did you already install the new update for Windows Phone or do you use the app on Android or iOS where _Qik Flik_ was already available?
