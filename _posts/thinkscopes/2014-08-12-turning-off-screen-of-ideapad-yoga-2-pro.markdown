For some reason Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro has included some key design elements that is missing in the current ThinkPad. One of the useful feature that the Yoga 2 Pro has, and that the ThinkPad does not, is the Function row shortcut key for switching off the internal LCD without having to close the screen lid.

This mean you can deliberately leave your laptop running without having the screen switched on by simply pressing the F9 key. Obviously, you can also do this by using automatic power timer, but i think it is more useful to have a shortcut key that you can allow you to kill the screen power when you need it.
