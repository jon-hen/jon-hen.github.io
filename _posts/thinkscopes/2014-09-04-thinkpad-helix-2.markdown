The successor to the ThinkPad Helix is coming! And it will feature dedicated buttons for the TrackPad. This is very good news!<!-- more -->


The ThinkPad Helix 2 will feature a Broadwell Core M CPU. It will be a fanless design unlike its predecessor which had a fan inside the tablet and on the keyboard dock. But they tended to be a bit noisy as I pointed out in the [review of the ThinkPad Helix](/blog/2014/08/11/thinkpad-helix-review/) earlier.
