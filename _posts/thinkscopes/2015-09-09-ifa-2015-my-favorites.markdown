IFA 2015 Berlin was a great experience, I would love to do again next year. Lenovo tried really well to innovate over the past 3 years. They have had their ups and downs, slowly improving over time. But at IFA 2015, Lenovo made a huge leap forward, leaving their competition way behind.

# Fingerprint readers on IdeaPads


Fingerprint readers on IdeaPads is something you'd usually not expect on a consumer level laptop. At the Lenovo booth, I spotted a red IdeaPad 300s which had a fingerprint reader equipped in the palm rest.

The fingerprint reader in the IdeaPad 300s is the fingerprint reader we knew from our previous generation ThinkPads, and not the new touch fingerprint reader Lenovo introduced with the Skylake generation of ThinkPads.

# Rotatable camera on the Yoga Tablet 3 series


The non-Pro editions of the Yoga Tablet 3 series have a camera which you can rotate 180 degrees so it is pointed towards the front, the back, or any direction you like. Because of this you only need to have one camera in your tablet.

This invention gives you a camera with many megapixels at the front and at the back at a very low price! This is one of the most innovative features besides the projector that I have seen on a tablet.

The rotatable camera is not available on the Yoga Tablet 3 Pro models, mostly because it would greatly reduce battery life due to the lack of space to install a battery because the projector is already occupying the cylinder.

# Projector in a 10" Yoga Tablet


Some people found that 13" Yoga Tablet 2 Pro was too large. Lenovo listened to user feedback and they decided to bring the projector to the 10" Yoga Tablet 3 Pro. Our sources say that there will be no 13" Yoga Tablet coming.

What did Lenovo do to keep the battery life? The engineers pulled a trick which allowed them to keep the 18-20 hours of battery life in the Yoga Tablet 3 10" Pro. If they didn't do this, the 10" Yoga Tablet 3 Pro would have less battery life because there is now less space in the cylinder.

What I also loved was that the projector was positioned in the middle of the cylinder in the Yoga Tablet 3 Pro series and no longer at the edge, projecting to the side. Because it was a little bit awkward as well losing the stereo sound of the Yoga Tablet when projecting a movie. Now you will always have one speaker on the left and one speaker on the right.

It may also be very interesting to know that the Yoga Tablet 3's speakers play even louder than its predecessors.

What do you think of the speakers in the previous generation Yoga Tablets? Is the positioning of the projector going to convince you to buy a Yoga Tablet 3 with a projector? Or is the availability of the projector in the 10" model going to convince you?


# ThinkPad E560 with a IPS display


One of the let downs in the ThinkPad E-series was that they never had any IPS display option available until now. I was quite surprised seeing a IPS panel in a ThinkPad E-series. I was so surprised, that I kept checking the viewing angles for nearly 15 minutes, because I simply thought that my eyes were playing tricks on me. But you have read it, it is the complete truth.

Will the availability of a IPS-panel influence your decision buying the ThinkPad E560?

# Miix 700


The Miix 700 has a high-resolution 3:2 display which is very pleasant to use in a tablet. The awkward 16:9 or 16:10 display ratio's look very weird when you use tablets in portrait rotation. Its predecessor, the Miix 3 10.1" has a 16:10 display ratio whereas the Miix 3 8" has a 4:3 display ratio.

Also interesting is the introduction of the kickstand in the new Miix 700 and the use of the watchband hinge. Previously, the tablet was supported by the keyboard dock, and the tablet itself did not have a kickstand. What do you think of the Miix 700's premium metallic kickstand and the watchband hinge? Or would you rather prefer the tablet being supported by the keyboard dock?

With the Miix 3 10" we only saw at most 4GB RAM configurations, which didn't make the Miix 3 10" suitable for heavier tasks. The new Miix 700 uses the Skylake-Y or Intel Core M line-up from Intel. The model at the Lenovo booth used a Intel Core m7 processor with 8GB of RAM

# ThinkPad Yoga 260 & 460


The materials used for the chassis in the ThinkPad Yoga's have changed. For the black model, Lenovo now uses carbon-fiber reinforced plastic, which is an alternative to aluminum magnesium alloy used in the older ThinkPad Yoga generations. Their performance is roughly the same, but still a little bit different.

The ThinkPad Yoga line-up is now available in black and silver. Also the black model is using paint. I thought this was going to affect the durability, but Lenovo guaranteed that the paint is very durable and wouldn't affect the MILSPEC certificate.

The black ThinkPad Yoga's are made of carbon-fiber reinforced plastics, which is a high-end material also found in the T450s and X1 Carbon series.

The silver ThinkPad Yoga's are made of aluminum magnesium alloy. The downside of the silver ThinkPad Yoga's is that they have no WWAN options available, due to the material used in the chassis, which shields the radio frequencies. Lenovo had to use aluminum magnesium alloy for the silver to increase the build quality and durability for the silver model.
