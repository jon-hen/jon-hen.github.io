I just recently received my first 4K LCD (ThinkVision Pro2840m) from Lenovo Australia, and i have to say this is one of the coolest monitor that i have ever played with in the recent years. But i will defer the actual detailed review of the ThinKVision Pro2840m to another day, this post is merely a short summary list of all the ThinkPad laptops (with Displayport/HDMI) that i have tested with the new ThinkVision 2840m. I have omitted some models from the compatibility list, as i do not own these models and i could not test their compatibility with the new 4K LCD. Following is the list of machines that i have tested, which shows support for the 4K resolution of the new ThinkVision Pro2840m (@30hz):



  * ThinkPad W701ds and W701 with Nvidia Quadro 3800m GPU

  * ThinkPad X201 with Intel HD GPU (must set the 4k LCD to DP 1.1 mode)

  * ThinkPad X201s with Intel HD GPU (must set the 4k LCD to DP 1.1 mode)

  * ThinkPad X201t with Intel HD GPU (must set the 4K LCD to DP 1.1 mode)

  * ThinkPad X220 with Intel HD 3000 GPU

  * ThinkPad X220t with Intel HD 3000 GPU

  * ThinkPad X230 with Intel HD 4000 GPU

  * ThinkPad X230t with Intel HD 4000 GPU

  * ThinkPad X240 with Intel HD 4400 GPU

  * ThinkPad T410s with Intel HD GPU (must set the 4K LCD to DP 1.1 mode)

  * ThinkPad T420s with Intel HD 3000 GPU

  * ThinkPad T430s with Intel HD 4000 GPU

  * ThinkPad T430u with Intel HD or Nvidia 620m GPU (DP only)

  * ThinkPad T440 with Intel HD 4400 GPU

  * ThinkPad T440s with Intel HD 4400 GPU

  * ThinkPad T440p with Intel HD 4400 GPU

  * ThinkPad T510 with Intel HD GPU

  * ThinkPad T520 with Intel HD 3000 GPU

  * ThinkPad T530 with Intel HD 4000 GPU

  * ThinkPad T540p with Intel HD 4000 GPU

  * ThinkPad W510 with Nvidia Quadro 880m GPU

  * ThinkPad W520 with Nvidia Quadro 1000/2000 GPU

  * ThinkPad W530 with Nvidia Quadro 1000m/2000m GPU

  * ThinkPad W540 with Nviddia Quadro K1100m/K2100m GPU

  * ThinkPad X1 with Intel HD (only Displayport)

  * ThinkPad X1 Carbon with Intel HD 4000 GPU

  * ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2014) with Intel HD4400 GPU (HDMI + DP)

  * ThinkPad Yoga Intel HD 4400 GPU (miniHDMI + Displayport)

  * IdeaPad Yoga 2 Pro Intel HD 4400 GPU (microHDMI)

  * IdeaPad Yoga 3 Pro Intel HD 5300 GPU (microHDMI)


Also, to note that there are a couple of ThinkPads that are capable of supporting 4K at 60 hz refresh rate. These machine models are:

  * ThinkPad W530 and W540 using Displayport

  * ThinkPad or IdeaPad with Intel HD5000 GPU


There also some older models of ThinkPad that i have tested, which does not support the ThinkVision Pro2840m LCD's 4K resolution, and won't work with the monitor when it is in DP 1.2 mode (so you have to switch the LCD to DP 1.1 mode).

  * ThinkPad X200, X200s, X200s

  * ThinkPad X301

  * ThinkPad T500 with Intel 4500MHD GPU

  * ThinkPad R500 with Intel 4500MHD GPU


These ThinkPads would only work with the ThinkVision Pro2840m when the Displayport is switched to the DP 1.1 mode, and they would only support the LCD at 2560x1600 resolution.
