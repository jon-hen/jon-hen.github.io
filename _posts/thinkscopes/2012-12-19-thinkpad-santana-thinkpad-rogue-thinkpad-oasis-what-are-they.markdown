Someone on Twitter presumably a Lenovo staff recently mentioned about some new ThinkPads that goes by the name of Santana, Rogue and Oasis. He also showed a picture containing a stack of new ThinkPad laptops that contains one of the new [laptop amongst them](http://t.co/IZ7uC1Qc) (This story was first reported by ibmthink at NBR forum). So what are these new ThinkPad laptops? are they the actual name of the new ThinkPad laptop (like Twist and Helix)? or are they code names for a generation of new laptops that Lenovo going to bring out next year? Initially, i speculated that these new laptops are the new replacements for the T, W and L series that is coming out next year. But apparently i am wrong, they are actually the new X series that is coming out next year?

So ThinkPad X231s, X241s, X240 should be the new ThinkPad Santana, Oasis, and Rogue? Further digging on Lenovo's publicly available information, also revealed that Lenovo will be releasing the T440s and T540s but no T440 or T540? Lot of interesting development going on. Also no ThinkPad W540 is mentioned, does that mean it is going to be culled or that Lenovo is still developing the new system?
