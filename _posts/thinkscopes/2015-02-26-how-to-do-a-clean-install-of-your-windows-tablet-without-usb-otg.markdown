If you are reading this article, you want to know how to do a clean installation of Windows 8.1 on your Windows tablet without using USB OTG and a USB flash drive.
 
 We will be using the Lenovo ThinkPad 8 for this article.
 


 	
  1. First of all we need to grab a Windows 8.1 ISO file that matches your license key, grab it from:
 - MSDN or TechNet
 - [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only)

 	
  2. Then, when downloaded, right-click the ISO file and then select **'Mount'** to mount the ISO as a virtual DVD drive.

 	
  3. Just run **'setup.exe'** to start the installation process.

 	
  4. Make sure your ThinkPad 8 is plugged in to charge.

 	
  5. Now make sure you select to do a complete reset, discarding **'keeping personal files'**.

 	
  6. It will take an 30-60minÂ to complete.

 	
  7. Then go to **'Control Panel' > 'Administrative Tools' > 'Disk Cleanup'**.

 	
  8. There you will see a blue link at the bottom of the dialog or window saying **'Clean up system files'**. Just select all files in the list. You should be freeing up around 25GB - 26GB doing so. Which increased the free space from 14GB to 40GB on my ThinkPad 8 (64GB).

 	
  9. Go to [http://support.lenovo.com/](http://support.lenovo.com/) and download **'ThinkVantage System Update'**.

 	
  10. Run 'ThinkVantage System Update', download and install all drivers.

 	
  11. Reboot

 	
  12. Done

 
 Quite easy right? No need to grab an USB OTG adapter.
 
 **Possible problems you might encounter:**
 


 	
  * You need enough free space before following this guide. The more the merrier.

 
 **Models this guide applies to:**
 


 	
  * ThinkPad 8

 	
  * ThinkPad 10

 	
  * Well just basically anything running Windows 8 or later.
