The ThinkPad X380 Yoga is the successor to the ThinkPad 370 Yoga. Lenovo decided to merge the ThinkPad Yoga 260 and ThinkPad Yoga 460 with Kaby Lake into a single ThinkPad Yoga 370. I'm ignoring the 11" models for education here, because those are a different subject. With Kaby Lake, we only had two choices: Either a ThinkPad X1 Yoga or a ThinkPad 370 Yoga. The ThinkPad X1 Yoga is obviously their flagship with the ThinkPad 370 Yoga being the runner up.

We will compare the ThinkPad X380 Yoga with the [ThinkPad L380 Yoga](/blog/2018/01/07/ces-2018-thinkpad-l380-yoga/) in a different article, but if you're looking for better upgradeability and don't mind the missing WWAN, then the ThinkPad L380 Yoga is the way to go generally.

The ThinkPad X380 Yoga is configurable up to the quad core Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake Refresh processors. The graphics card is a Intel UHD 620, which is 100MHz clocked higher than its predecessor.

Being an X-series ThinkPad, we're seeing two camera choices, a 720p camera or a IR camera for facial recognition. There is no ThinkShutter available on this model.

The memory is configurable up to 16GB DDR4 2400MHz. However, do note the memory is soldered in a dual channel configuration. If you want more memory, I suggest you look at the [ThinkPad L380 Yoga](/blog/2018/01/07/ces-2018-thinkpad-l380-yoga/).

The ThinkPad X380 Yoga has no 2.5" hard drives available, that being said, there are only NMVe PCIe SSDs to choose from.

Battery life is up to 13.6 hours with a 51Wh integrated non-swappable battery. Charging can be accelerated with the RapidCharge feature. Battery capacity hasn't changed compared to its predecessor, but battery life has slightly improved by 1.1 hours.

The WWAN-card options are again the Fibocom L850-GL and L830-EB.

The display is a Full HD IPS display with touch at 300 nit.

The ThinkPad X380 Yoga is 18.2 mm thin which is the same as its predecessor, the ThinkPad 370 Yoga. Weight however has slightly increased to 1.4kg coming from 1.37kg.
