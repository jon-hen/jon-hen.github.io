As the year has already passed its zenith, the new Skylake CPUs come closer and closer. Naturally, the time of speculation and announcements is now beginning again. :-)

As we did discover already in my last article about Skylake ([see here: Intel Skylake Roadmap leak](/blog/2015/05/intel-skylake-roadmap-leak-plattform-overview-and-thinkpad-speculation/)), Skylake is coming in different flavors, as all Intel Core i CPUs before, and Skylake will have a staggered launch, with some models releasing before others, lets take a look at that roadmap again, shall we?

As we see in this table, the Quad-Core Skylake models, Skylake H, are to be released earlier this year than the Dual-Core U-Series of CPUs. That might mean that we might see new Quad-Core machines a tad earlier than the other model...maybe.

Fitting to these logical conclusions taken from the roadmap, Lenovo now teased a big announcement regarding workstations for the 10th of August, showing an unknown ThinkPad!

What ThinkPad this is? What exactly are the specs? Who knows...

Well, Lenovo does, of course. We will sure be watching what will be announced in one week!
