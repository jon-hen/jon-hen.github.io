ThinkPad RapidCharge battery was first debuted in the ThinkPad X1 in 2011, it allowed the battery to be charged from flat to 80% within 30 minutes. This RapidCharge technology that Lenovo uses is different to the lithium rapid charge technology that most other companies use, which are based on [using high voltage](”http://www.google.com/patents/US20070075682?hl=zh-CN&dq=5661645&ei=iJolUP_GIeH5igL7xoGYCg”) (to compensate for internatl resistances within the cells). The Lenovo RapidCharge technology is based on high current, which is apparently better for the battery longevity than the high voltage version of the rapid charge battery technology.

Currently, there are only a few ThinkPad that uses the RapidCharge technology, which are:

1. ThinkPad X1

2. ThinkPad X1 Carbon and ThinkPad X1 Carbon Touch

3. ThinkPad T430s with 4 cells Li-polymer battery.

4. ThinkPad X230t with 4 cells battery.
