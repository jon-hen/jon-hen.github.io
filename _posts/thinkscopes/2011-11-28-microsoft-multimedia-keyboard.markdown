**Price:** $59 AUD (the price i got it at)

**Score:** 9.5/10

**Pros:**

-The best Microsoft keyboard ever (well in the last 15 years or so).

-Super comfortable to type on (thanks to the correctly shaped palmrest).

-Very good key feel

-All the multimedia keys are placed in the right spot and with the correct size.

-The best dome switch keyboard ever produced (runs circle around its competitions).

-A very good typist keyboard

-Super reliable

-Available in both wired and wireless version

-Available in Blue/White or Black/Dark Grey (i like the latter colour combo since i use Think branded products).

**Cons:**

-No longer produced

**Verdict:**

This is one of the best dome switch keyboard that i have ever used, it combines supreme comfort with an moderately tactile key feel (when compared to mechanical switch keyboards). The ergonomics of this keyboard with its palmrest are spot on, you could basically type on them all day and not feel any sort of fatigue in your hand or in your fingers. It is so good, i got 4 of them.

# Review


I got the first Microsoft Multimedia keyboard in year 2002, which seems to be almost an eternity in computer technology. This keyboard helped me with lot of report typing and is probably the longest in service keyboard that i had so far, i was using it everyday for couple of years straight. While the white plastic started to gain a yellow stain, the key mechanism was as sharp as ever and registered all my typing without ever missing a click or two. Another milestone that this keyboard helped me to achieve was touch typing, and it also increased my typing speed from 20 wpm to about 65 wpm (the highest for me was about 80 wpm but that could only achieved with a Unicomp keyboard).

This keyboard is extremely comfortable to use, as the palmrest is elevated high and when typing the hands are in a neutral position, which decrease fatigues in the hand/fingers. Another positive thing about this keyboard is the tactility of the key, which positively reinforces the typist’s typing speed.

I have used over 50 keyboards of different models and brands, this would be one of the best keyboard under 100 dollars. The only keyboards that can really beat it would be the IBM Model M (and Unicomp’s version of it) and Filco Majestouch 2 with Brown Cherry key, however none of these keyboards have the correct ergonomics like that of the Microsoft Multimedia keyboard.

While, the wired version of this keyboard no longer sold, there are still some wireless version available with the same positive key feel, but they don’t come with the palmrest for some odd reason (and the bundled wireless Microsoft Mouse is useless).

Conclusion

The best Microsoft keyboard ever produced in the last 15 years, a real classic on its own right. It combines excellent ergonomics with good key feel, making it an unbeatable keyboard for typists on a tight budget. Also, the multimedia keys and shortcut keys on this keyboard are placed correctly (according to the usefulness of the function they offer) a rarity nowadays.
