The acquisition of [Mojang AB](https://mojang.com/) by Microsoft is now bearing fruit!

It was [announced ](https://mojang.com/2014/12/pocket-edition-comes-to-windows-phones/)on Wednesday that Minecraft Pocket Edition would be now available for Windows Phone.

If you want to download the game from the Windows Phone Store, you should note that there is no demo version available, so you'll have to pay the £4.99/$6.99/5,99€ to play it.

According to the description in the STORE, "Minecraft is a game about placing blocks and going on adventures". While there are some features you'll only find in the PC version, "Pocket Edition includes Survival and Creative modes, multiplayer over a local Wi-Fi network, infinite worlds, caves, new biomes, mobs, villages and lots more".

I never played Minecraft and I don't think this would change anytime soon, but maybe it's interesting for some Windows Phone users?

Let me know if you play Minecraft in the comment section below!.
