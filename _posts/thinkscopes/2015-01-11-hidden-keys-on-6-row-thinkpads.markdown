With the 7-row to 6-row transition in 2012, the standard ThinkPad keyboard lost some keys - to be exact, the new layout has 5 keys less. The functions assigned to these keys were mostly legacy functions most people don´t use and are only needed for very specific tasks, like scroll-lock, system-request, break or pause. Also the menu key.
 
 What you may not know however: These functions still exist, even though their names are not printed on the keys they are now assigned for. Therefore, they are hidden functions now.
 
 On Ivy-Bridge, Haswell and Broadwell ThinkPads, and propably future generations with the same layout as well, these hidden functions are:
 


 	
  * Fn + B: Break

 	
  * Fn + K: ScrLK

 	
  * Fn + P: Pause

 	
  * Fn + S: SysRq

 	
  * FN + 4: Standby

 
 The Fn + 4 function was actually added later on the Haswell models with a BIOS update (propably due to customer demand), so don´t wonder if this function doesn´t work on an early Haswell or an Ivy-Bridge ThinkPad.
