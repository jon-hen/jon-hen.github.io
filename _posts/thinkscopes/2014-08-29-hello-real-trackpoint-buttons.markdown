Apparently, the new ThinkPad Helix 2 will feature real trackpoint buttons, and not the hybrid TrackPoint and TrackPad buttons that we have seen in the ThinkPad Helix. This is a great piece of news, as the hybrid TrackPoint buttons were never that great. I had a hard time getting used to the hybrid TrackPoint buttons in the T440s, X1 Carbon, ThinkPad Yoga, X240 and W540. After one year, i am still getting use to them, talk about a steep learning curve. Hopefully, the dedicated trackpoint button that is making a come back in the ThinkPad Helix 2 will be a sign of things to come for the rest of the ThinkPad range (i have a feeling it is, wink wink).
