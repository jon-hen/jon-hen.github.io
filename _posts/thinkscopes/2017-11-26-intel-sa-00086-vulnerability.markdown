The Intel SA-00086 is a critical vulnerability found in the Intel Management Engine.

Attackers can gain unauthorized access to systems using Intel® ME feature, and 3rd party secrets protected by the Intel® Management Engine (ME), Intel® Server Platform Service (SPS), or Intel® Trusted Execution Engine (TXE).

This includes the following scenarios where an attacker could:
  * Impersonate the ME/SPS/TXE, thereby impacting local security feature attestation validity.
  * Load and execute arbitrary code outside the visibility of the user and operating system. 	
  * Cause a system crash or system instability
