Since 2015, the mainstream market was dominated by dual core Intel Core U-series processors, while only the workstation models offered quad core Intel Core H-series to the consumers. The last ThinkPad to fill that gap between mainstream and high-end laptops was the ThinkPad T540p from the Intel Haswell generation.

For the years that followed, we still had a 15" ThinkPad T-series, but it only featured a dual core Intel Core U-series processor and it was so heavy and slow like you wouldn't believe.

The v-suffix stands for value. Meaning there are a few sacrifices to be made, but not many. The most notable changes are cheaper graphics cards, 33% lower battery capacity, 1x less USB-C port, and less display panels to choose from.

The ThinkPad P15v does weigh 700 grams less than the ThinkPad P15, making it a very portable option. It's still going to slightly weigh you down, but not as much as you might think.

The ThinkPad P15v seems to be perfect for me as a software developer. In the worst case scenario's I've only had meetings last up to 2-3 hours. And even then, there were still plenty of power sockets available around the conference tables.
