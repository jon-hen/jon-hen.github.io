When Lenovo released the ThinkPad USB keyboard with TrackPoint back in late 2009, lot of avid ThinkPadders requested Lenovo to release a wireless version of this keyboard, but non have been released. But Lenovo obviously have taken the requests of the ThinkPad users seriously, as they are about to release the new ThinkPad Bluetooth Keyboard with TrackPoint, which is modeled after the new ThinkPad Precision keyboard (more preciously same as the ThinkPad T430u keyboard).Â

Since the new ThinkPad Bluetooth Keyboard uses the ThinkPad T430u keyboard layout, it therefore has a very large spacebar unlike the regular Precision keyboards that are fitted to the normal T430s an T430.

Also, from the released picture of the ThinkPad Bluetooth Keyboard has an integrated keyboard backlight (noted from the blue icons on the spacebar).

P.S. Once again i have to thank IBMThink for telling me about this yet to be released Lenovo Product.

==================================================

Update: The new ThinkPad Bluetooth Keyboard will have an integrated battery that lasts up to 1 month, and can be charged using the micro usb cable (included with the keyboard). It will also have a NFC feature, which allows fast device pairing. Finally, there is no backlit feature mentioned in the release.

It will cost around $100 dollars. I have ordered one, so i am waiting for delivery at the end of April.
