There are two full sized HDMI ports on the back of the ThinkVision Pro2840m monitor:



  * HDMI 1.4 port on the monitor supports 4K resolution

  * MHL port is a HDMI 1.3 port, which doesn't support 4K resolution


So if you want to use 4K resolution on the ThinkVision Pro2840m, make sure you have a laptop or desktop that supports HDMI 1.4, and it is connected to the HDMI 1.4 port on the ThinkVision monitor (and not the MHL port on the LCD).
