If you have a ThinkPad T420 or T430, you probably have experienced the accidental ejection of the Ultrabay drive by accidentally pressing on the long ejection button. So how do you resolve the issues of ejecting ultrabay drive.

There are several ways of solving the issues.

1) You can first use the software (called LockCD), a freeware.

2) Swap the current ultrabay drive with a different kind of ultrabay drive (one with a square button).
