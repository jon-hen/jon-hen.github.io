The release date of Windows 10 was announced on [the blog of Microsoft](http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/06/01/hello-world-windows-10-available-on-july-29/)Â and is set for a July 29 release and not end of August according to the documents that leaked from Newegg last week.

Know that Windows 10 will be available for download before July 29 as this is the release date for Windows 10 RTM being sold as retail. Windows 10 will hit RTM one month sooner.

Windows 7 users and newer will be able to upgrade for free to Windows 10 during the first year.
