So it has came to my attention that Lenovo North America does not offer the 4 cells rapidcharge battery option on their eCommerce website, and some of the T430s owners are getting confused as to which batteries have RapidCharge feature.

For those whom do not know, the ThinkPad T430s has three battery options, which are:

1. 3 cells Ultrabay battery.

2. 6 cells main battery (T81+)

3. 4 cells main battery (T82+).

Only the 4 cells main battery (T82+) is a rapid charge model, in which you charge up to 80% of the battery capacity within 30 minutes (with a 90 watts adapter). The 4 cells Rapid Charge battery option is not available in the Northern American market (not sure why) when i checked at the end of October 2012.
