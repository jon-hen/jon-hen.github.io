Microsoft [announced ](http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2014/12/05/cortana-arrives-in-france-italy-germany-and-spain-as-a-preview/)today that the voice assistant **Cortana** will be available as a preview version from today on in France, Italy, Germany and Spain.

If you want to use the Cortana preview, you'll have to install the latest update for the Windows Phone developer preview that is being rolled out later today.

To install the update, you have to go to **settings -> phone update -> check for updates.**

If you aren't registered to the Preview for Developers yet, you should do the following:



  * Register for a [Dev Center Account ](http://dev.windows.com/en-us/join)_or/and_

  * Register for an [App Studio Account](https://appstudio.windows.com/en-us) _or/and_

  * Developer unlock your Windows Phone


After that, you have to download the [Preview for Developers app](http://www.windowsphone.com/de-de/store/app/preview-for-developers/178ac8a1-6519-4a0b-960c-038393741e96) from the Windows Phone Store. Open the app and follow the on-screen instructionsÂ to receive the newest Windows Phone updates earlier.

In my opinion, it's really a shame that it took Microsoft so long to release Cortana in Germany and the other nations, especially if you keep in mind that Siri was available in English, German and French from the beginning on.

What do you think about Cortana? Needless knickknack or important feature?
