title: Spartan Browser - The perfect browser we have been waiting for?
category: tech

The past few years, the browser choice was usually pretty obvious is you wanted the fastest and most compatible browser with any website. Everyone went with Google Chrome.
 
 Now **the quality of Google Chrome has seriously detoriated** over the years. I have been wondering what Google has been hiding in Chrome, because Chrome tends to use a lot more RAM than Internet Explorer. On my fancy ThinkPad 8 tablet with 2GB of RAM I can only keep 1 tab open in Chrome before running out of RAM. Worst of all is that the more extensions you have in Chrome, the more RAM it seems to be using.
 
 Just open a random product page at http://shop.lenovo.com/ and you will also notice that videos will start playing automatically, without displaying something. It looks like background music you cannot turn off. But the website works fine in Internet Explorer regardless.
 
 **And seriously, does Facebook really need to consume 1GB of RAM to display one single web page?** Why does it use so much RAM? 5-7 years ago, you would 20-25MB of RAM usage at most per tab. Things have obviously changed now. Whatever Facebook is doing in the background. I do not approve. If you have a laptop with 8GB of RAM which is quite common these days, you will still run out of RAM pretty quickly if you leave Facebook open just because of this.
 
 **Then there is Mozilla Firefox, the browser with the less friendly UI that tends to be a lot slower than Chrome**, even nowadays. It feels just slow, even slower than Internet Explorer. Mozilla has been sitting in the background for a while now, and it looks like they don't plan on leaving the shadow quite soon.
 
 Okay, that leaves us with less popular browsers right now, but I am not a fan of experimenting with Opera Browser or Maxthon Browser. Why would I? If nobody else uses these browsers, then why should I?
 
 That leaves me with Internet Explorer. If you have a recent Windows version, or you are running Windows 8.1, you will find that Internet Explorer is quite decent and fast too. **But this brings us to the reason why Internet Explorer has a bad reputation.**
 
 Most people don't tend to purchase the latest version of Windows, because it is expensive or their programs might not run on it.  But if you do not purchase the latest version of Windows, you will end up using an older version of Internet Explorer as well, because Microsoft refuses to update the browser in older operating systems. Quite a shame. And then you have to depend on the goodwill of web developers and pray their website is compatible with your aged browser. Now with Windows 8, Internet Explorer has been seriously improved, being quite smooth actually. One of my favorite browsers that has actually never let me down, unlike Google Chrome.
 
 **This brings us to Spartan Browser**, a new browser built from the ground up based on ModernUI. It is actually a universal application that can be shared on both desktop, tablets and phones. This means that the browser will perform as well as it does on your PC. If it has a syncing feature, it will be a very deadly alternative to Chrome, knowing it will be compatibile with Mac OSX and iOS, and hopefully with Linux as well. Spartan Browser can be updated using the Windows Store, making it possibly independent from the operating system version. It also means if a vulnerability is found, we wouldn't depend on the manufacturer to release an update.
 
 Maybe that the TV series "Spartacus" can give a good nickname to Microsoft's new much promising browser. **"I AM SPARTACUS"**, right?
