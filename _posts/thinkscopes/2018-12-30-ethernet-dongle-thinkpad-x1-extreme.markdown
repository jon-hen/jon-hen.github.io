title: Which ethernet dongle for ThinkPad X1 Extreme?

As of writing this article, there are two Ethernet dongles (RJ-45) available for the ThinkPad X1 series. This article will explain to you which is the correct Ethernet dongle for the ThinkPad X1 Extreme. We will refer to the available dongles in the article as generation 1 and generation 2.

The 2nd generation Ethernet dongle will not work for your ThinkPad X1 Extreme (2018). However, when trying to find your Ethernet dongle, you'll find two different 'part numbers', the marketing part number is used in the web stores of Lenovo, while the other is an actual part number or FRU.

Identifiers:



 	
  * Marketing part number: **4X90F84315**

 	
  * Field Replaceable Unit (FRU): **04X6435**

From  the perspective of someone who cares about the environment, I am happy Lenovo excluded the cable from the box. I can't remember when I used an Ethernet cable last time myself.

Feel free to share your opinion below whether you feel the Ethernet dongle should have been included in the box or not.
