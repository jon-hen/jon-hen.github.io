If you are enrolled in the Windows Phone Preview for Developers program, it's time for you to go to **settings -> phone update -> check for updates**, because Microsoft published Build 8.10.14203.306 recently.

There are several new features:



  * possibility to add the _battery saver_ to the action center

  * "real-time" live tile for the _battery saver_

  * possibility to select the preferred install date for phone updates


Speaking of the _battery saver_ app, don't miss its latest update which added some nice features like a more detailed view of the time since last charge and the estimated time remaining as well as the possibility to view percentages of battery use by the different apps.

If you aren't registered to the Preview for Developers yet, you should do the following:



  * Register for a [Dev Center Account ](http://dev.windows.com/en-us/join)_or/and_

  * Register for an [App Studio Account](https://appstudio.windows.com/en-us) _or/and_

  * Developer unlock your Windows Phone


After that, you have to download the [Preview for Developers app](http://www.windowsphone.com/de-de/store/app/preview-for-developers/178ac8a1-6519-4a0b-960c-038393741e96) from the Windows Phone Store. Open the app and follow the on-screen instructions to receive the newest Windows Phone updates earlier.
